On behalf of the National American Space Agency (NASA) welcome to mars! You have been chosen as the sole astronaut to go look after the NASA Martian colony, what a great honour! While you’re there you must preform some daily activities to turn a profit, if you produce over a certain amount each cycle (5 days) then we will send a rocket with some supplies for you. We are very glad you decided to take up this position, it has been very difficult getting willing astronauts to go, and the ones who do don’t last very long. But I’m sure you’ll do great! There have been some reports of “aggressive blob like figures” roaming around at night, try to avoid them (and maybe kill them)

Due to these reports we are sending some extra weapons with you, you have a gun which you can activate by pressing the B button on your right controller, shoot by pressing A, change back to your regular controller by pressing B again. You can place weapons by pressing Y, this defaults to the stationary cannon which shoots a bullet every 3 seconds for 40 seconds before disintegrating.

For ease of movement around the planet we have also equipped you with a teleportation module, simply aim wherever you wish to go with your left hand, then press the hand trigger to go there.

You can collect Martian rocks (floating spheres) by pressed the index trigger on your left controller and touching the object, a count of the amount of rocks collected is displayed on the table in the hub, try and collect as much as possible in order to generate a profit and send back samples.

Have fun, please try not to die. NASA
